                <h3> Reverence </h3>
                <p>
                    To hold with deep respect & wonder. To be reverent of our food source is the first step to understanding just how precious life really is. Especially with meditating on the life-capacity of a seed, or the process of photosynthesis, or how the life-sustaining-capacity can pass from life to death, in order to give life to another.</p>
                <h3> Stewardship </h3>
                <p>
                    To care for creation as it was designed to function; to feed, nourish, and engage. As we spend time farming, we more intimately gain insight into the vast complexities, connectedness, and order of the creation were a part of. It is something intimate, tangible, nourishing, and it brings us to a humble joy for having the chance to know it in such a way.</p>

                <h3> Craft </h3>
                <p>
                    Since farming has been an occupation from the dawn of civilization, and methods of foraging & hunting pre-date farming, many of the principles are timeless, and as such, the craft of farming has developed into a rich, meaningful work-rhythm upon which society & culture are built within the "wild" ecosystem around us. We strive to better equip ourselves as students of the craft to help create value for the people, families, and community near us.</p>
